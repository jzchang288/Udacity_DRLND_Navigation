# Navigation Project Report
The goal of the project is to construct an agent and then train it to navigate the banana field to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding the blue bananas. This is equivalent to maximizing the score for an episode, which is defined as the cumulative sum of the rewards collected during the episode. The criterion for an agent to solve the environment is to get an average score of 13 or more in 100 consecutive episodes.

## Introduction

In my implementation, the basic architecture of the agent is the [Deep Q-Network (DQN)](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf) developed by Volodymyr Mnih, et al.
